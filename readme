PREREQUISITES

To make this work, you need the ability to create e-mail accounts.
One way to do this is to request your ISP to create the extra
accounts for you, because the mail server doesn't have to be on
the same machine as Major Major.  Another way to do it is to
become your own postmaster, by installing a mail server (e.g. Weasel)
on your own computer.

You can get Weasel from the same place as you got this program.
If you don't like Weasel, you can find other SMTP and POP3
servers by looking in the usual OS/2 archive sites, for
example <http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/>.


INSTALLATION

Create a suitable directory, e.g. D:\Apps\Major.  Unzip the zip
file into that directory.  (If you are upgrading from an earlier
version, unzip into the same directory as you used for that
earlier version, so that you can continue to use your existing
configuration data.)  Now you are ready to go.

The script makefolder.cmd is optional.  If you run it, it will
create a folder on the desktop containing appropriate program
objects.  The desktop folder is a convenience, but is not
essential.

There are two executables.  Admin.EXE is the configuration program,
and you should run this first.  (And you should run it again any
time you want to create a new mailing list, delete a mailing list,
etc.)

Note that Admin.EXE does NOT create e-mail accounts.  You have to
do this in your mail server software.  You need at least two
mail accounts: one for Major Major itself -- this is the e-mail
address that receives things like "subscribe" requests -- and
then one for each mailing list you create.  To run N mailing
lists you need N+1 e-mail accounts.

Major.EXE is the program that checks for mail, sends out mail to
people on the mailing lists, etc.  You should leave this
running all the time.  If you need to terminate it, type Ctrl/C.
Alternatively, you may terminate it by running the Rexx script
Shutmajor.cmd that you will find in the 'tools' subdirectory.
This automated shutdown method will be useful if you use a
technique (such as that found in xWorkplace) that cleanly closes
running applications during shutdown of the operating system.

The 'tools' directory can be ignored by most people.  Most of
the tools are Rexx scripts to do things that would normally be
done by running the Admin.exe program.  They are useful if you
want to automate some operations.  (For example, controlling
Major Major from a web interface.)

The 'Canned' directory contains some sample messages.  If you
edit these, I suggest you give your versions different file names,
or put them in a different directory, so that your customised
files will not be overwritten when you upgrade to a future new
version of Major Major.
