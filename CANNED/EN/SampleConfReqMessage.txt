This is a confirmation request for a subscription or
unsubscription of %S to the mailing list %L
on this server. You, or someone acting on your behalf,
has sent a request to subscribe you to, or unsubscribe
you from, the mailing list %L. As a guard against
malicious requests, this request will be ignored unless
you confirm it within %H hours. The random code in the
Subject: line of this message is designed to block fake
confirmations from people pretending to be you.

If this is a genuine request, you should reply to this
message, keeping the same Subject line. The body of
the reply will be ignored, but the Subject line must
remain unchanged.

If you do NOT want the request to be accepted, you may
ignore this message.
