Commands to this mailing list processor must be sent as plain
text.  This program will do its best to find the text part of
your message, if any, but if it turns out that the commands
are embedded inside an HTML web page document, they might not
be processed properly.

Many people do not realise that what they are sending is not
plain text, because they are using mail software that comes
preconfigured to use a less desirable format.  Solutions to this
problem, for some of the more popular mail programs, are
explained on the web page
